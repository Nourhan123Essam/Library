# üìö Library Management System

## üìù Project Description

Welcome to the **Library Management System**! This system allows users to manage books, authors, publishers, readers, checkouts, and the relationships between these entities. It includes functionalities such as:

- Managing books, categories, authors, and publishers
- Managing readers and their checkouts
- Tracking which books are checked out by which readers and their due dates
- Supporting multiple authors for a book and multiple publishers for a book

The system uses a relational database to store data and manage the relationships between these entities.

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Overview

The **Library Management System** uses a normalized database schema with several tables to manage the data. The relationships between entities are modeled using foreign keys and normalization techniques to ensure data integrity and reduce redundancy.

## üìä Database Entities

The following entities are part of the system:

- **Books**: Represents books in the library.
- **Authors**: Represents authors who have written books.
- **Publishers**: Represents publishers of books.
- **Readers**: Represents readers who borrow books.
- **Checkouts**: Represents records of books checked out by readers.
- **CheckedBooks**: Represents the details of the books checked out in each checkout.
- **Categories**: Represents categories or genres of books.
- **BookAuthors**: Represents the many-to-many relationship between books and authors.
- **BookPublishers**: Represents the many-to-many relationship between books and publishers.

## üîó Database Design

The database is designed with the following relationships:

- A **book** can have multiple **authors** (many-to-many).
- A **book** can have multiple **publishers** (many-to-many).
- A **book** relates to one **category** but a **category** can have multiple books (one-to-many).
- A **reader** can make many **checkouts** (one-to-many).
- A **checkout** has many **checked books** (one-to-many), with each **checked book** relating to a specific **book** and **checkout**.

## üìê Database Diagrams

The following diagrams visually represent the structure of the database:

- **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**: Shows the relationships between entities in the database.
- **Normalization Diagram**: Illustrates the normalization of the database to reduce redundancy and ensure data integrity.
- **Schema Diagram**: Represents the actual schema of the database, including tables and fields.

## Stored Objects üõ†Ô∏è
Stored objects include **Tables**, **Stored Procedures**, **Functions**, **Triggers**, and **Views**. These objects are essential for storing complex queries and business logic in the database.

### Benefits of Using Stored Objects:
- **Performance**: By using stored objects, SQL Server can create and cache the **Execution Plan** one time. This saves time and resources by preventing the need to recreate the execution plan with each query.
- **Best Practice**: It's a best practice to create stored objects for frequently used queries to improve **performance** and optimize **resource usage**.
- **Indexing**: Indexing is crucial for **performance** but should be used carefully. Indexes improve query speed but can cause overhead on **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, and **DELETE** operations. A balance is needed.

### Security Enhancement üîí:
Stored objects also enhance the **security** of the database by:
- **Encapsulating logic**: Prevents direct access to sensitive tables and controls the data that can be accessed or modified.
- **User permissions**: Allows you to grant permissions to execute stored procedures, functions, and views without exposing underlying tables.
- **Reduced SQL injection risk**: Using parameterized queries inside stored procedures mitigates the risk of SQL injection attacks.
- **Centralized control**: Security policies can be centralized in stored procedures, ensuring consistent enforcement across the database.

### üìå **Stored Objects That Benefit from Indexing**
Indexes significantly improve the performance of specific stored objects by optimizing query execution. Here are the stored objects that see noticeable benefits:

- **`GetBooksByCategory`** (Stored Procedure): Retrieves books by category.  
- **`GetBookByAuthor`** (Stored Procedure): Retrieves books by a specific author.  
- **`BooksWithCategoriesAndAuthors`** (View): Displays books along with their categories and authors.

### üîç **Analyzing the Impact of Indexing: `GetBookByAuthor` Stored Procedure**
Let's compare the performance of the `GetBookByAuthor` stored procedure **before** and **after** applying an index.

---

#### üö´ **Without Index**
- The execution plan for the `GetBookByAuthor` stored procedure shows the following results:
  - **Physical Operation**: `Clustered Index Scan` (This indicates a row-by-row search, relying on the default primary key index).
  - **Actual Number of Rows Read**: **534** rows.  
  - This operation is less efficient because a full table scan is performed.

*Figure 1: Execution Plan Without Index for `GetBookByAuthor` Stored Procedure*

---

#### ‚úÖ **With Index**
- After creating a **non-clustered index** on the `AuthorId` column in the `BookAuthors` table, the execution plan shows significant improvements:
  - **Physical Operation**: `Index Seek` (This uses the newly created index, allowing subtree-based searching for faster lookups).
  - **Actual Number of Rows Read**: **4** rows (a drastic reduction compared to 534 rows).  
  - This operation is much more efficient as the query directly navigates to the relevant rows.

### üéØ **Key Takeaways**
- **Without Index**: The query performs a `Clustered Index Scan`, leading to higher read operations and slower performance.  
- **With Index**: The query performs an `Index Seek`, drastically reducing the number of rows read and improving performance.  
- Proper indexing optimizes query execution, reduces table scans, and enhances overall system performance.

### Stored Objects That Don't Require Indexes:
These stored objects perform well without the need for indexes:
- **CalculateOverdueDays** (Function): Calculates overdue days for checkouts.
- **GetReaderFullName** (Function): Returns the full name of the reader.
- **AddNewBook** (Stored Procedure): Adds a new book to the library.
- **DeleteBook** (Stored Procedure): Deletes a book from the library.
- **UpdateBookDetails** (Stored Procedure): Updates book details.
- **BooksWithAuthorsAndPublishers** (View): Retrieves book names along with authors and publishers.
